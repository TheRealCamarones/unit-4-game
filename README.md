# Crystal Collector Game
An assignment for the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. Create a game in browser using click events in jQuery. The object of the game is to dynamically generate a random number, followed by four crystals with randomly assigned rotating hidden values. Using logic try to make your score match the target number by clicking on the crystals. Each click will increase your number by the crystal's value, but the value will never directly be revealed directly.

Added some mobile responsiveness to make sure it looks pretty on all screens and functions great in the phone as well using click events. Really enjoyed the math behind this one, it's essentially a take on blackjack.
